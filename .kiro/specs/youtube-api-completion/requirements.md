# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will complete the implementation of essential YouTube Data API v3 endpoints in the MCP YouTube server. Currently, the server implements core video, channel, and trending functionality, but is missing several important API endpoints that would provide comprehensive YouTube data access for AI applications. The goal is to implement the remaining essential APIs while maintaining the existing token-optimized, structured response format and caching strategy.

5. IF comments are disabled or restricted THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
6. WHEN processing comment text THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting and handle special characters properly

### Requirement 3: Channel Content Discovery APIs

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want comprehensive channel content access, so that I can analyze channel uploads, playlists, and content organization patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting channel sections THEN the system SHALL return organized content sections like uploads, playlists, and featured content
2. WHEN requesting channel playlists THEN the system SHALL return all public playlists created by the channel
3. WHEN requesting channel uploads THEN the system SHALL return the channel's upload playlist for chronological video access
4. WHEN fetching channel activities THEN the system SHALL return recent channel activities and updates
5. WHEN requesting channel branding THEN the system SHALL return banner images, profile images, and branding elements

### Requirement 4: Advanced Search and Discovery APIs

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want enhanced search capabilities, so that I can perform complex content discovery with multiple filters and criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching with location parameters THEN the system SHALL return geographically relevant results
2. WHEN searching with time-based filters THEN the system SHALL support precise date range filtering
3. WHEN searching channels THEN the system SHALL return channel results with comprehensive metadata
4. WHEN using advanced search parameters THEN the system SHALL support event type filtering (live, completed, upcoming)
5. WHEN searching with relevance language THEN the system SHALL return results optimized for specific languages

### Requirement 5: Live Streaming and Events APIs

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want to access live streaming data, so that I can analyze live content, upcoming events, and streaming patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting live broadcasts THEN the system SHALL return active live streams with viewer counts and metadata
2. WHEN requesting upcoming events THEN the system SHALL return scheduled live streams and premieres
3. WHEN fetching live chat THEN the system SHALL return live chat messages and interactions
4. WHEN requesting stream details THEN the system SHALL return technical streaming information and statistics
5. IF live features are not available THEN the system SHALL handle permissions and availability gracefully

### Requirement 6: Subscription and Relationship APIs

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want to access subscription data, so that I can analyze channel relationships and audience overlap patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting channel subscriptions THEN the system SHALL return channels that a user/channel subscribes to
2. WHEN requesting subscribers THEN the system SHALL return subscriber information where available
3. WHEN checking subscription status THEN the system SHALL verify if one channel subscribes to another
4. IF subscription data is private THEN the system SHALL handle privacy restrictions appropriately
5. WHEN fetching subscription feeds THEN the system SHALL return recent uploads from subscribed channels

### Requirement 7: Analytics and Reporting APIs

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want access to YouTube Analytics data, so that I can provide insights on performance metrics and audience behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting video analytics THEN the system SHALL return view patterns, traffic sources, and audience retention data
2. WHEN requesting channel analytics THEN the system SHALL return subscriber growth, view trends, and demographic data
3. WHEN fetching revenue data THEN the system SHALL return monetization metrics where authorized
4. WHEN requesting geographic data THEN the system SHALL return location-based viewership statistics
5. IF analytics access is restricted THEN the system SHALL handle authorization requirements properly

### Requirement 8: Content Management APIs

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want content management capabilities, so that I can help users organize and manage their YouTube content programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating playlists THEN the system SHALL support playlist creation with proper metadata
2. WHEN updating video metadata THEN the system SHALL allow title, description, and tag modifications
3. WHEN managing playlist items THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, and reordering videos
4. WHEN setting video thumbnails THEN the system SHALL support custom thumbnail uploads
5. IF content management requires authentication THEN the system SHALL handle OAuth flows properly

### Requirement 9: Token Optimization and Response Formatting

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want consistent token-optimized responses, so that I can minimize LLM token consumption while accessing comprehensive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning API responses THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing lean response format
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide configurable detail levels to control token usage
3. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL use appropriate TTL values based on data volatility
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses consistent with existing patterns
5. WHEN transforming API data THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary fields and optimize data structures

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility and Integration
